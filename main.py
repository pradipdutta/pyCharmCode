'''[note]
PEMDAS is an acronym that stands for the order of operations in mathematics. It helps to determine the sequence in which various mathematical operations should be performed to evaluate an expression. PEMDAS stands for:

1. P: Parentheses - Perform operations inside parentheses first.
2. E: Exponents - Evaluate exponentiation (i.e., powers and roots).
3. MD: Multiplication and Division - Perform multiplication and division from left to right.
4. AS: Addition and Subtraction - Perform addition and subtraction from left to right.

Following the PEMDAS order ensures that mathematical expressions are evaluated correctly and consistently. Here's an example of how PEMDAS is applied:

1. Solve 3 + 2 x (4 - 1)^2.

   Applying PEMDAS:
   1. Start with parentheses: 4 - 1 = 3.
   2. Next, exponentiation: 3^2 = 9.
   3. Then, multiplication: 2 x 9 = 18.
   4. Finally, addition: 3 + 18 = 21.

So, the expression evaluates to 21, following the PEMDAS order.
